NAME OF THE CHALLENGE: dedup
Step 0:
    - Extract pack.tar.gz

Step 1:
    - Delete all duplicated files
        - A file is said to be a "duplicate" if its content is the same as another file.
        - You MUST keep one and only one copy of that file

Step 2:
    - Put the "pack" folder in one compressed archive AND add it to your repository:
        - The compressed archive MUST be in the tar.gz format
        - The compressed archive MUST be named "dedup.tar.gz"
